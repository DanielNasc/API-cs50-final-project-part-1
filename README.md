# MY CS50 FINAL PROJECT
## Credentials
Create a dotenv file with the following data:

```
API_KEY="your firebase api key"
AUTH_DOMAIN="firebase again"
PROJECT_ID="firebase again again"
SECRET_KEY="your secret key for user data encryption"
```

## Why are client and server together in the same project?
So I can upload them all at once to cs50, but I'm going to separate them into other branches
